# Connecture

*This project is based on the concept of making new and meaningful connections. By providing access to all college peers on a single platform, getting to know peers with a similar interest can help to guide and inspire students. We already have many sophisticated social platforms to connect with people, but, a setup at an institute-level would significantly help to bind everyone by leveraging the ability to connect digitally.* :octocat:

## Installation of node modules: :rocket:

The technology stack used in this project is the MERN stack, which has some dependencies. To run this code, your system would need node modules, and hereâ€™s how you can install them and run this project.

### Steps: :octopus:
1. Download the latest version of Node.js corresponding to your OS.


2. Go to the root folder of the project and run the following commands in your terminal:

` ` `~ npm install` ` `

This will install node modules in your root folder.

` ` `~ cd client` ` `

` ` `~ npm install` ` `

This will install node modules in your client folder.

3. To run frontend/client side, run the command

` ` `~ npm run client` ` `

4. To run server and backend, run the command

` ` `~ npm run server` ` `
 
5. To run both, run the command

` ` `~ npm run dev` ` `

If you have installed node modules correctly, and have run these commands successfully, then React will run this website on your local server. :dart:
